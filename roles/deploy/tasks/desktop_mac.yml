# This file is kept for reference, in case I need to work on MacOS again, or just want to refer to it.

# Things that were still TODO when I stopped using a Mac :
#
# General issues that need solving :
# * find a tiling window manager
# * copy-paste keyboard shortcuts
# * screenshots with equivalent funtionality
# * automatic focus of windows when hovering with mouse
# * ssh-agent
# * Ctrl-backspace to delete word
# * The fact that Ctrl and Cmd are basically reversed between MacOS and *, leading to confusion when switching OSes
#
# Fixed manually, to automate :
# * install brew
# * install qwerty-lafayette
#
# Stuff that I found nice on MacOS, and wish I had on Linux
# * Dead keys representation in (almost all) text fields
# * Permission management across the system (popup to allow terminal to access downloads directory...)
# * Per-app notification permissions
# * maybe move rofi to cmd + space (this shortcut is cool)
# * Consistent copy-paste shortcut across everything (including terminal)

# Notes and references on tiling wm and input system :
# * Notes on Apple keyboard layout configuration language (older but still valid, except next point)
#   * https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2056/_index.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS10003085-CH1-SUBSECTION16
# * Apple keyboard layout configuration language does not allow for differeciated Alt/AltGr keys
#   * https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/431564/keyboard-layout-with-differentiated-option-keys-alt-altgr
# * Please note that (if I remember correctly) ukulele generates config files for that same language, so, same limitations
# * Therefore, we need to use a lower-level workaround. Karabiner-elements seems to be the best option at this point.
#   * I was thinking of adding a Karabiner output format to https://github.com/fabi1cazenave/kalamine. Kazé seems OK with it, but haven't done anything yet.
# * skhd might be able to do it too. Unsure.
#
# * For a tiling wm, https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai seems to be the best solution. A bit hacky but mostly works so far.
#   * Maybe https://github.com/ianyh/Amethyst, otherwise

### Package manager ###

# NB : since the desktop/server distinction doesn't make sense for a mac, we install all packages here, and none in packages.yml
# TODO : Install brew itself
- name: Install desktop packages (Darwin)
  homebrew:
    name:
      - alacritty   # GPU-powered terminal emulator

      - md5sha1sum  # for command md5sum
      - eza
      - prettyping

      # NB : those need to be enabled manually with :
      # * brew services start yabai
      # * brew services start skhd
      - koekeishiya/formulae/yabai  # tiling window manager
      - koekeishiya/formulae/skhd   # hotkey daemon
      # NB : install currently doesn't work
      # NB : cf https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/docs/getting-started/installation/ for initial setup
      # TODO : skhd and karabiner are redundant. Make a choice
      # - karabiner-elements          # keyboard customization

### Keyboard layouts ###

- name: Create custom fonts directory
  file:
    state:  directory
    path:   "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/Library/Keyboard Layouts"

# NB : this makes the layout available, you still have to select it in options
- name: Download qwerty-lafayette
  get_url:
    dest:     "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/Library/Keyboard Layouts/"
    url:      https://qwerty-lafayette.org/releases/lafayette_macosx_v0.6.keylayout
    checksum: "sha1:a0492cd50b8118a304a462de067825f40a689c28"

### Alacritty ###

- name: Load alacritty config via .config/alacritty.yml

### Graphical environment Themes ###

# N/A to Mac

### yabai & skhd ###

# NB : we're not setting up the scripting addition because :
# * it requires disabling SIP, which is not advisable security-wise
# * it doesn't support M1 Macs anyway
