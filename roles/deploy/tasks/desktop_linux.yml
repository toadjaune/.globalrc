### Locale ###

# The entire locale standard is quite brittle and can break stuff in unexpected ways.
# Be careful when changing anything here.
# https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/commit/1e70e82baa91

# We want to set a locale with the following properties (by order of priority, I guess) :
# * English language
# * UTF-8 encoding
# * YYYY-MM-DD date format
# * 24h hour format
# * Week starts on monday
#
# Ideally, without resorting to building a custom locale, or installing any extra locale
# To this day, en_DK.UTF-8 looks like our best candidate, it only misses the weekday start, which I don't mind that much.
# TODO : See if we can find a better locale ?

# Ways to test a given locale :
# * LANG=en_DK.utf8 locale -k LC_TIME
# * LANG=en_DK.utf8 date

# Various programs respect the date format with various levels
# For example, Thunderbird, in its default config, reads the locale, and displays the date in the follwing formats :
# * en_US.UTF-8 : mm/dd/aa    -> makes sense
# * fr_FR.UTF-8 : dd/mm/aaaa  -> makes sense
# * en_DK.UTF-8 : dd/mm/aaaa  -> This format does not appear anywhere in this locale ...
# bug : https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1707128
# workaround : https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/customize-date-time-formats-thunderbird

# Ways of setting up system locale
# https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/fedora/latest/system-administrators-guide/basic-system-configuration/System_Locale_and_Keyboard_Configuration/
# https://wiki.debian.org/Locale
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Locale#Setting_the_locale
# We currently don't set it as it is very invasive, and I'm worried about weird side effects, see later if it is required anyway.
# When launching sway through gdm, $LANG is overridden for the graphical session anyway.

# Setting up locale via Gnome for GDM to load is surprisingly hard too. The following were tried and could not be made to work :
# * Using ~/.dmrc (apparently only works for GDM 2.x, legacy)
# * Setting $LANG in ~/.config/environment.d/
#
# Using the gnome settings window (gnome-control-center), you can actually configure it. There are 2 parameters in its "Region & Language" section :
# * Language : sets $LANG.
#   I have no idea where this is stored, and found no way to set it programmatically.
#   Gnome propagates this change to the system locale (visible in `localectl status`), but it doesn't work the other way round.
#   I'm lost here, and honestly, if we really need to configure this, ditching GDM altogether might be worth considering.
# * Formats : sets various $LC_* variables.
#   This one corresponds to the org.gnome.system.locale/region gsettings key
#   But setting a value with `gsettings set org.gnome.system.locale region en_DK.UTF-8` does not work either.
#
# I've given up, just change it with gnome-control-center
#
# These changes require at least logging out, but you might as well reboot at every step, honestly.
