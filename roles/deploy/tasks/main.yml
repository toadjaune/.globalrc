  # We have several machines in the inventory on which we're supposed to only
  # ever deploy locally. Instead of always having to use --limit, or make some
  # complicated setup with groups, or use different inventories (etc), we start
  # with all of them, and fail it if the hostname doesn't match.
  #
  # It's a bit ugly, but far less error-prone and more convenient than relying on some
  # manual/local configuration
