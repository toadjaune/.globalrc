### Output configuration
#
# The wallpaper path is relative to sway config file
output * bg "{{ ansible_user_dir }}/{{ sway_wallpaper_path }}" fill
#
# Example configuration:
#
#   output HDMI-A-1 resolution 1920x1080 position 1920,0
#
# You can get the names of your outputs by running: swaymsg -t get_outputs

# For a laptop, this is the integrated screen

    bindcode $h output '*' enable , mode "default"

    ### Manual screen management
    # Should rarely be used now, since we have kanshi

    # Primary-only, ie laptop screen only
    # NB :
    # * we can't just disable * then enable the only screen we want, because then it leaves a phase with no screen

#
# This will lock your screen after 300 seconds of inactivity, then turn off
# your displays after another 300 seconds, and turn your screens back on when

### Input configuration
#
# Example configuration:

### Start/configure various daemons

# Some userspace daemons come packaged with userpace systemd unit configurations (/usr/lib/systemd/user/)
# This is preferable to manually starting them here, as we can leverage systemd's facilities for :
# * logging
# * daemon lifecycle :
#   * auto-restart
#   * asynchronous lazy loading (typically via DBus)
#   * daemon unaffected by sway restart, no orphaned process...
#
# Currently identified daemons using this mechanism :
# * mako (notification daemon, started via DBus, requires $WAYLAND_DISPLAY)
# * ssh-agent (custom unit added by this role)
# * xdg-desktop-portal (Portal manager, started via DBus, requires $XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP, see below)
# * xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (wayland-related portals implementation, started via DBus, see below)
# * darkman (light/dark theme manager and portal implementation, started by systemd, see below)
#
# Environment in ~/.config/environment.d/ is included in systemd user unit environments, as well as various variables set by sway
# * `systemctl --user show-environment`
# * https://bugs.archlinux.org/task/63021
# This is not the case for $WAYLAND_DISPLAY, which is needed by daemons interacting with wayland, but that we don't want to hardcode
# The cleanest way I found to do this is to propagate the value set by sway into the systemd config
exec_always systemctl --user import-environment WAYLAND_DISPLAY

# The Freedesktop Portal system allows apps to ask for extra permissions, such as screen sharing
# Works even (especially, even) for sandboxed apps (flatpak...)
# xdg-desktop-portal is autostarted via dbus, and receives such requests.
# It then dispatches them to actual implementations, such as xdg-desktop-portal-wlr (wlroots, for sway and co) or xdg-desktop-portal-gnome
# Without the XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP set to sway, xdg-desktop-portal gets confused, and falls back to gnome imprementations. Which breaks on sway.
# Therefore, we configure it here. We can't put it in ~/.config/environment.d/, because then in breaks portals on Gnome.
# In a sway-only environment, we could also not have xdg-desktop-portal-gnome installed in the first place.
# Extra info :
# * https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/wiki/systemd-user-services,-pam,-and-environment-variables
# * https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/wiki/%22It-doesn't-work%22-Troubleshooting-Checklist
# * https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/wiki/Screencast-Compatibility
# * `/usr/libexec/xdg-desktop-portal -vr` to start it manually, with extra logs, and see what DBus interfaces are bound to what.
# * `/usr/libexec/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr -l DEBUG -r`
# * https://flatpak.github.io/xdg-desktop-portal/ -> List of interfaces
# It's possible to configure xdg-desktop-portal-wlr, notably to choose how it will make you choose between outputs to share,
# see `man 5 xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`. Could for example use wofi instead of slurp... (TODO ?)
exec_always systemctl --user set-environment XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP=sway

# Wayland screen sharing notes
#
# Screen sharing of native Wayland windows uses PipeWire and XDG Portals (see above)
#
# On sway (or any wlroots-based compositor), we only get to stream entire screens at once, no way to stream a specific window :
# * https://github.com/emersion/xdg-desktop-portal-wlr/issues/107
# * https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/wlroots/wlr-protocols/-/issues/93
#
# As of 2023-11-09, it works seamlessly for streaming clients implementing it properly (e.g. firefox, chromium...), but some shitty clients
# (slack, Discord...) fail to make it work properly (cf above at their launch keybinding definitions)
# Those programs however tend to retain the ability to stream windows through the X protocol, meaning we can still share Xwayland windows through those broken programs.
# xwaylandvideobridge is a ~hack~ compatibility layer that captures a wayland window, and exposes it as its X window content.
# It works, but far from seamlessly (you get multiple desktop choice steps, it's sensible to window aspect ratio, etc)
# Here's how we currently use it :
# * it's installed through dnf. Nothing autostarts it.
# * whenever you want to use it, start it manually (typically through rofi)
# * ensure its window occupies an entire desktop
# * ensure its desktop is on the screen you're about to share
# * go back to your streaming program, and share a window through it (the window is named "Wayland to X11 Video Bridge")
# * enjoy
#
# Potential future improvements to consider, depending on how it ends up working :
# * removing it entirely once those programs fix their shit. This would be ideal, and since all programs affected here are electron, it just might happen eventually
# * autostarting it ? There's a kde flatpak that could help with that
# * autostarting it manually from sway ?
# * configuring sway to hide the window ?

# darkman (light/dark theme runtime switching)
#
# So, for the basic idea :
# There is a freedesktop property (org.freedesktop.appearance color-scheme) that describes the user preference,
# with 3 possible values : no-preference (0), prefer-dark (1), prefer-light(2)
# https://blogs.gnome.org/alicem/2021/10/04/dark-style-preference/
# https://github.com/flatpak/xdg-desktop-portal/blob/d7a304a00697d7d608821253cd013f3b97ac0fb6/data/org.freedesktop.impl.portal.Settings.xml#L33-L45
#
# We use https://gitlab.com/WhyNotHugo/darkman, which provides a simple cli to choose the preference, and exposes it through its portal implementation
#
# Gnome of course implements it too.
# It maps it to the org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme setting, which means we can set it with :
# gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface color-scheme prefer-dark
#
# With no specific setup, darkman should auto-start as a user systemd unit
# (NB : might need a reboot if it was just installed)
#
# If you have any doubt about which portal implementation has precedence, directly query dbus for the current value with :
# dbus-send --session --print-reply=literal --reply-timeout=1000 --dest=org.freedesktop.portal.Desktop /org/freedesktop/portal/desktop org.freedesktop.portal.Settings.Read string:'org.freedesktop.appearance' string:'color-scheme'
#
# Most GTK programs honor it unless GTK_THEME envvar is defined
# A few examples to test for when changing those :
# * firefox's own chrome (interface) follows GTK_THEME first, then this
# * nautilus, same
# * firefox web pages follow this regardless of GTK_THEME
# * Dark Reader extension can be configured to follow it (independently of its per-site global exclude list)
# * thunderbird follows it regardless of GTK_THEME
#
# Electron's detection logic is currently (2023-08-03) broken :
# https://github.com/electron/electron/issues/33635
#
# TODO : Possible next steps :
# * Make various other desktop apps honor the preference
#   * slack
#   * vscodium
# * Terminal/shell theme ?
# * Auto background change ?

# Manual toggle between light and dark theme
bindcode $mod+$y exec darkman toggle && notify-send --urgency=low "Switched to $(darkman get) mode"
# At startup, use dark mode
exec darkman set dark

# Polkit agent (allow graphical programs to request permissions with higher granularity than sudo)
# We need to start a polkit agent manually. Any of them should do.
# Start gparted as a non-privileged user to test the setup.

# https://www.freedesktop.org/software/polkit/docs/latest/polkit.8.html
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Polkit
# TODO : lxpolkit is kind of ugly, see what agent we can replace it with
exec lxpolkit

# TODO : Find a way to replicate this functionality, since the Wayland protocol prevents this by design
# Will likely require explicit support from the compositor
# Start redshift
# This reduces the amount of blue light emitted by the screen based
# on the time of the day
# We currently use the default config
# exec redshift

# kanshi : daemon autoloading monitors layouts based on which ones are plugged
# TODO : maybe move it to a systemd user unit ?
exec kanshi
# When reloading sway config, reload kanshi configuration
exec_always kanshictl reload
