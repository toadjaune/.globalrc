#!/bin/sh

# This script is installed to /usr/local/bin/firefox, so that every invocation of firefox uses the configuration made here.
# This is especially important because an instance started without the Wayland flag won't be able to open a new tab in an alredy existing instance on wayland, but will try and raise an error.
# This includes clicking on links on various apps.
# Also note that some apps, if started through XWayland, will still error despite this setup
#
# The types of invocations we want to cover include :
# * .desktop file (Various graphical tools, rofi in drun mode, etc...) (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Desktop_entries)
# * bare binary (cli, rofi in run mode, etc...)
# * XDG (default program for opening links) (https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Default_applications, https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/XDG_MIME_Applications)
#
# Several other options were considered but too limited :
# * sway keybinding :
#   * Only affects direct sway invocations
# * Override firefox.desktop file (or make another one) :
#   * Only affects desktop-based starts
#   * Requires maintaining the entire .desktop file, which might otherwise be updated by the distro, different across distros, etc...
# * Custom binary in a directory added to the user $PATH :
#   * There is no way to configure the $PATH change so that every single program invoked from the graphical session will respect it
#   * Therefore, will only ever affect some of the invocation modes mentioned above
# * Shell alias : Only affects shell
# * Combinations of several solutions above : could probably be made to work almost always, but :
#   * No guarantee that we can cover everything
#   * Extra complexity in setup and understanding
# * Firefox setting via config file :
#   * Maybe possible, but if so, I did not understand how (TODO ?)
#
# In the end, putting this script in a system path is the only reliable way I found.
# I don't like much having globalrc setup leaking out of my personal user setup, but so far I have seen no setup where I need a graphical setup on a shared computer, so this should be fine.

# Problems currently identified to be caused by this setting :
# * Bitwarden / Dark Reader extension panels weird flickering (https://github.com/bitwarden/browser/issues/2068 ?)

# Enable WebRender support
# WebRender is Firefox's new rust-based compositor, extracted from servo : https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/Quantum_Render
# It is now enabled by default everywhere ... except on Wayland : https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/GFX/WebRender_Where
# It can still be disabled if hardware acceleration is disabled/unavailable.
# To check if it is enabled, look at the gfx.webrender.enabled flag in about:config, or "Compositing" in about:support
