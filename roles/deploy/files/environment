# GTK3 & GTK4 theme configuration
# It seems GTK4 (or at least nautilus) cannot be configured through config files in .config
# Since this is the only setting we currently need to change, this should be fine for now
# https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GTK
# NB : I haven't found yet a way to explicitly configure a theme family, while still
# honoring runtime dark theme switching with org.freedesktop.appearance.color-scheme
# for that reason we remove this for now, and let GTK apps use the default theme.
# TODO : drawback : without this setting, some apps display an ugly white top bar
#   It's possible to add this envvar to their specific invocation, though

# Configure theme for Qt5 applications (such as vlc)
# NB : There does not seem to be any kind of support for auto-switch in VLC 3.x
# Maybe the 4.0 will implement it ?
# NB : I can't think of any other Qt app I'm using.
